## RDBMS

RDBMS is Implementation of Relational database management system which is the first assignment on the course neural-symbolic.

It is a data base managment system that store structured data using tables(rows and columns);

  

## Tables as Relations

A relational data model using n-ary relation to store data

    R = {(a1,...,an) | a1 E A1 ,a2 E A2, ...,an E An}

 ##### where 
 

 - A table is a relation
 - Rows are n-tuples
 - Columns/Atributes comes from a defined set called Domain

##### Each attribute requires a uniqu identifier/name

  

## Relational Schima and Relational instance
A relational Schima contains the table name and it's atribute name.

A relational instance is a set of finite tuples created with a predefined schema.
Look at the example below,it is the relational schima where table name is student and Name,Age and Department are Attributes.

  

|     | Students |  |
----------|-------|------
|Name |Age |Department |

Based on this relational Schima we can create a table that of students info.

  

Name | Age |Department
-------|------|--------
| Kirubel |24 |CompEng |
| Bemehiret |23 |SoftEng |
| Debora |23 |CompEng |
| Elias |25 |ElecEng |

  

## Query Operations on RDBMS
We have six operations on the tables

1. **Union** : It is a relation between two tables where the resulting table will contain the information of both tables.

It is denoted by:

    R1 U R2 = {(a1,...,an) | (a1,...,an) E R1 V (a1,..,an) E R1}

> Note both the tables must have the same relational schema i.e. Attributes must match .

  

2. **Intersection** : It is a relation between two tables where the resulting table will contain information duplicated in both tables.

It is denoted by:


    R1 n R2 = {(a1,...,an) | (a1,..,an) E R1 & (a1,..,an) E R2 }

  

>Note both the tables must have the same relational schema ie. Attributes must match .

  

3. **Difference** : It is a relation between two tables where the resulting table will contain the information of the first table with out information in second table.

It is denoted by:

    R1 - R2 = {(a1,...,an) | (a1,..,an) E R1 & ~((a1,..,an) E R2)}

>Note both the tables must have the same relational schema ie. Attributes must match .

  

4. **Projection**

5. **Selection**

6. **Natural join**

## Commands for the User Interface

The following commands are supported to use the RDBMS from command line

 1. Create a relational schema with the specified name and attributes list
    >```create,rschema,<rschema name>,<list of column names>```

    >e.g: ```create,rschema,Student,Name,Age```    
    where ```Student``` is rschema name and ```Name,Age``` is list of column names.
2. Create an empty table with a given table name and table specification (i.e. relational schema)
    >```create,table,<table name>,<name of rschema>```

    >e.g: ```create,table,Attendance,Student```    
    where ```Attendance``` is the table name and ```Student``` is the name of the relational schema instance to use as specification for the table.
3. Insert a row into an existing table
    >```insert,<table name>,<row to insert>```

    >e.g: ```insert,Attendance,Kirub,25```    
    where ```Attendance``` is the table name to insert into and ```Kirub,25``` is the data to be inserted into the Attendance table.
4. Display data stored in a table
    >```display,<table name>```

    >e.g: ```display,Attendance```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the table to be displayed.
5. Remove a row of data from a table
    >```remove,row,<table name>,<row to remove>```

    >e.g: ```remove,row,Attendance,Kirub,25```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the table and ```Kirub,25``` is the data to be removed.
6. Remove or delete an existing table
    >```remove,table,<table name>```

    >e.g: ```remove,Attendance```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the table to be removed or deleted.
7. Union of two tables
    >```union,<first table name>,<second table name>```

    >e.g: ```union,Attendance,Grade```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the first table and ```Grade``` is name of the second table.    
8. Intersection of two tables
    >```intersection,<first table name>,<second table name>```

    >e.g: ```intersection,Attendance,Grade```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the first table and ```Grade``` is name of the second table. 
9. Difference of two tables
    >```difference,<first table name>,<second table name>```

    >e.g: ```difference,Attendance,Grade```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the first table and ```Grade``` is name of the second table
10. Projection of a table on to a list of attributes (i.e. columns)
    >```projection,<table name>,<list of column names>```

    >e.g: ```projection,Attendance,Name```    
    where ```Attendance``` is the table name and ```Name``` is columns list with single column names.
    
    _More column names can be specified in the columns list_
11. Select a row from a table with a given value for a column
    >```select,<table name>,<column name>,<value>```

    >e.g: ```select,Attendance,Age,25```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the table to select from, ```Age``` is the column used for selection and ```25``` is the value at the selection column.
12. Natural Join of the two tables
    >```Njoin,<first table name>,<second table name>```

    >e.g: ```Njoin,Attendance,Grade```    
    where ```Attendance``` is name of the first table and ```Grade``` is name of the second table.
13. Clear screen
    >```cls```
14. Exit the program
    >```exit```

## Building and Installing

Perform the following steps at the shell prompt:
> ```cd /to/project/root_dir```

> ```mkdir build```

> ```cd build```

> ```cmake ..```

> ```make -j```

> ```sudo make install``` *# install in /usr/local*

> ```make DESTDIR=/installation/path/ install``` *# install in user defined directory. e.g: ~/Desktop/rdbms*
